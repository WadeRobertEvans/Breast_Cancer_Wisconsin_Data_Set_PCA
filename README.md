# Breast_Cancer_Wisconsin_Data_Set_PCA
Follow on work from repo "Breast_Cancer_Wisconsin_Data_Set"; however, I now use Principal Component Analysis (unsupervised learning)   

## Principal Component Analysis
Used Scikit Learn   
Used StandardScaler   

### Model 1
* n components = 2

### Model 2
* n components = 3

### Model 3
* n components = 10

## K Means Clustering
